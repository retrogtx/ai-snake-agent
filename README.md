# Snake Game AI

## Overview
This is a Snake game AI implemented in Python using Pygame. The AI agent learns to play the Snake game by training a neural network model. A game like this is useful to know how reinforcement learning works!

This project was possible with the help of Patrick Lober's youtube video. He explained everything beautifully even to a beginner like me.

## How to Run
1. Install the required dependencies: Pygame, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
2. Run the `agent.py` file to train the AI agent:
   ```bash
   python agent.py
   ```

## Building blocks
- The AI agent uses a Deep Q-Learning algorithm to learn and improve its gameplay.
- The training progress is visualized using Matplotlib to show game scores and mean scores over time.
- Made with Pygame & Pytorch
